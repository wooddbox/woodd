## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I make this thing work in my theme?

All you have to do is add this simple shortcode to a WordPress page: `[isotope-posts]`. For maximum results, add it to a page with a full-width template.

### What kind of Isotope options are available?

Isotope Posts takes advantage of a number of the original jQuery plugins's options. On the plugin settings page you have the option to:

* Add a filter menu (based on post categories or tags, or a custom taxonomy)
* Arrange your posts descending by date or ascending alphabetically by title
* Choose whether to use display evenly in horizontal rows or masonry-style.

### Does this plugin work with custom post types and taxonomies?

Absolutely. To use a custom post type, simply add its slug to the designated field on the plugin settings page. Same goes for using a custom taxonomy for a filter menu.

### Is it localized?

Yes, but no translations are available quite yet.
